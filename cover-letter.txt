[Live Demo: https://proposal-sparkle-12.lovable.app] - I built this for you to show I understand your project.

Hi,

Based on what you described, this barcode reader modernization lives or dies on three systems: offline data sync, camera and external reader integration, and cross-platform feature parity.

Since I've done this before, I can help you avoid common mistakes:

- Offline operation: Most teams assume connectivity and lose data during outages. I use SQLite as the source of truth with background sync queues that resolve conflicts automatically.

- Reader integration: Camera APIs are tricky and external readers like Zebra or Honeywell need proper HID handling. I build a unified abstraction layer with auto-detection so switching between camera and hardware readers is seamless.

- Legacy modernization: Big-bang rewrites fail 70% of the time. I use the strangler fig pattern with feature flags, migrating piece by piece while keeping the existing app running.

The repo is public - feel free to use any of this for your own work if it inspires you. I'd be grateful for the opportunity to work together.

Thanks,
Humam
